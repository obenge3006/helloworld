Just getting started

Hi everyone

well i was just reading an article on Quora.com and found myself here. am glad i did anyway because i have wanted to code since i was in my teens but in my world just could not happen for various reason **not blaming anyone though** so i find this as an opportunity to get started and hopefully get there :)
